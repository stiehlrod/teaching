      Get-Started Schedules - Midrange

      05/11/02

      This schedule accelerates faster than the most basic one, so it’s best for 
      new runners who have some existing fitness - from another sport, perhaps. 
      Still, a gentle start is crucial, so be patient in the first weeks. And if 
      it becomes too hard, don’t be afraid to repeat a week or two. 
      If you can already jog for 30 minutes at a time, start on Week 3.
